.. important::

    As of January 2014 apub is available only in form of very,
    *very* early and unstable alpha releases via a separate fury.io package
    index. Use these early alpha releases at your own risk -- especially since
    the API has not been frozen yet.


At the command line::

    $ pip install apub

Or, if you have virtualenvwrapper installed::

    $ mkvirtualenv apub
    $ pip install apub
