        Notes:
            The current implementation schema of apply_to might prove
            inefficient, because every single substitution leads to an
            additional iteration the splitted lines of text.

            If this proves true, the implementation should be changed to an
            approach that is based on a single split and a single iteration
            over all lines, diring which all substitutions get applied to a
            line at the same time while retaining the order of application
            defined in the json project.
